# stream-wootric

A data stream generator for the Wootric API, written in python 3.

## Limitations

### Creation Date Clustering

The Wootric API limits results to 50 per request and only allows
sorting by created_at. For instances where more than 50 records have
an identical created_at date and time, it is therefore impossible to
access certain data points. In this cse, the streamer increments its
bookmark by one second and proceeds with its replication in order to
avoid a crash or infinite loop.

### Record Updates

The Wootric API does not allow you to order results by updated_at or
filter based on updated_at date. As a result, there is no way to
incrementally upsert updated records. To capture any changes in
records that have been previously updated, conduct a full replication.

## Install

Clone this repository, and then:

```bash
â€º python setup.py install
```

## Run

#### Run the application

`stream-wootric` can be run with:

```bash

stream-wootric sync -c config.json -s state.json

```

Where `config.json` contains the following, retrieved from the API
section of your Wootric account settings page:

```json
{
  "client_id": "a64characterstring...",
  "client_secret": "another64characterstring..."
}
```

and `state.json` is a file containing only the value of the last state
message.
